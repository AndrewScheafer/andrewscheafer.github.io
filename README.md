## to edit basic website content (title, emial, description)
use _config.yml

## to edit home page
edit index.markdown

## to add new page
create a new .markdown file at the root of the directory. Don't create abything in _site unless you want it to be overwritten, and only write  a page in _posts (with naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-sub-url) if you want it to come up as a post. If you want it to be an individual page with its own tab in the nav bar, jsut create a .md page like `about.markdown`
